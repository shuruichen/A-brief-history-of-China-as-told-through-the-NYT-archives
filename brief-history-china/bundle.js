     <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_of_China" >America-backed nationalists lost ground</a> to the communists in the
      <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Civil_War">Chinese Civil War</a>, 
     America ceased aid to the nationalist government in 1949. Not until the 
     outbreak of <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_War">the Korean War</a> in 1951, did America reach out to the nationalists 
     yet withdrawn to <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Formosa">Formosa</a> (Taiwan) as to seek partners for larger struggle behind 
     the war --- conflict between communist nations (Soviet, China) and capitalist nations
      (America). Such opposition also presented itself in China's attempt at foreign trade.
       Whereas <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_trade_of_the_Soviet_Union">the Soviets claimed half of China's international business</a> , America retained
        tight trade controls on China. Despite American views, though, Britain relaxed curb
         on trading with China. In the U.N., there was much debate on whether the government
          based in Beijing could replace that in Taiwan as China’s representation in the world body. `,
    `The 1960s were a decade of rift, parley, and pact for China. To the north,
     the Soviet's abrupt recall of experts from China in 1960 first strained 
     Sino-Soviet relations which, afterward, further deteriorated with

 To the west, India disputed with China over 
 <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Indian_border_dispute#1967_Nathu_La_and_Cho_La_clashes">sovereignty at the Tibetan border</a> . China sought 
 to make a pact with India but failed, which eventually converted into frontier fights. 
 To the south, China felt threatened by America’s military aid to South Vietnam in the 
 <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War">Vietnam War</a> . In response, China offered arms to North Vietnam and sent armies to help
  it combat America and South Vietnam.`,
    `In contrast to the last decade, China’s diplomatic success dominated coverage in the 1970s.

Domestically, however, disaster struck. Tangshan, a mining city of one million people in North China, was destroyed by <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1976_Tangshan_earthquake
">a historic earthquake</a>, where the loss was extremely high.`,
    `With Reagan’s ascension to the presidency in the 1980s, Taiwan became the forefront of discussion on China. China<a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/1980/08/23/archives/china-bitterly-attacks-reagan-as-bush-prepares-to-leave-peking.html

The course of events ended as <a target="_blank" href="">military suppression of students at Tianmen Square in 1989</a>. Last but not least, America’s interests in Chinese art increased in this decade, as many articles on Chinese art exhibition reviews, Chinese art history, etc were published.`,
    `As the legacy of the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, dissidents and human rights were prominent in the 1990s. America repeatedly asked China to release arrested dissidents, some of whom later removed to America and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/28/world/highest-us-rights-official-meets-with-leading-chinese-dissident.html

">arose some criticism</a> in American officials. In 1997, Hong Kong occupied headlines. As it prepared to revert to China's rule, there was much attention on China revocating its civil rights laws. Next year, America’s focus swang to Clinton’s visit to China, where right issues were highlighted in surprisingly frank talks.

">addressed to students on liberty</a>. Interestingly, this decade witnessed a series of journals on Chinese cities, whose scope covered not only major cities but also small towns with special characters.`,
    `The 2000s were a decade of trading success for China. In 2001, China joined the WTO after numerous complex negotiations, though amid doubts. In consequence, the Chinese bank industry, stoke markets, and IPO markets sprung to life. Many multinational enterprises began dealing with China. On the other side, the rise to Taiwan leadership of an anti-China candidate,<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chen_Shui-bian
"> Chen Shui-bian</a>, caused new anxieties for China’s government and Sino-American relations. Whereas China pressed America on the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-China_policy#:~:text=The%20%22One%2DChina%20policy%22,official%20names%20incorporate%20%22China%22.
">‘one-china’ policy</a>, America continued thrusting human rights issues on China. These two topics both appeared in Bush's visit to China in 2001.
